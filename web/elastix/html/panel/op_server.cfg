; You will need to specify special meetme extensions and another

; When attendant transfer fails to originate the call to the destination
; you can specify a custom failure redirect with the parameter
; attendant_failure_redirect_to. For example, you can redirect
; the call to voicemail if the attendant fails. If this parameter is commented
; the call will be bridged back to the transferrer. In this example, if you
; try to transfer to extension 100 and it fails, the call will be transferred
; to 6100 instead (where you can have the voicemail app, or anything else, 
; maybe a queue, etc).

; You can have panel contexts with their own
