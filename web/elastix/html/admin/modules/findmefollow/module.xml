	<description>
		Much like a ring group, but works on individual extensions. When someone calls the extension, it can be setup to ring for a number of seconds before trying to ring other extensions and/or external numbers, or to ring all at once, or in other various 'hunt' configurations. Most commonly used to ring someone's cell phone if they don't answer their extension.
