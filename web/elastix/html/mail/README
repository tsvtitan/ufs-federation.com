RoundCube Webmail (http://roundcube.net)


Introduction:
-------------
RoundCube Webmail is a browser-based multilingual IMAP client with an
application-like user interface. It provides full functionality you expect
from an e-mail client, including MIME support, address book, folder management,
message searching and spell checking. RoundCube Webmail is written in PHP and
requires the MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLite database. The user interface is fully
skinnable using XHTML and CSS 2.

This project is meant to be a modern webmail solution which is easy to
install/configure and that runs on a standard PHP plus MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLite
configuration. It includes open-source classes/libraries like PEAR
(http://pear.php.net) and the IMAP wrapper from IlohaMail
(http://www.ilohamail.org).

The current development skin uses icons designed by Stephen Horlander and Kevin 
Gerich for Mozilla.org.
